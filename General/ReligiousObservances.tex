\entry{Policy on \mbox{religious} \mbox{observance}}{Students who intend to observe religious holidays must inform their teachers in writing as prescribed in the ISEP Policy on Religious Observance (ISEP Section III-D), within the first two weeks of the semester. Forms for this purpose are available from your teacher. Your teacher will inform you of any modifications to planned course activities resulting from the teacher's own religious commitments.  }

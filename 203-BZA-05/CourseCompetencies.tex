\entry{Course \mbox{competencies}}
{This course will allow the student to fully achieve the competency:

OOUV: To analyze different physical situations and phenomena of interest to engineers and scientists using the fundamental laws of mechanics and to use computers to model various phenomena and to gather data in pertinent experiments.
\begin{enumerate}
\item To analyze a wide variety of rotational phenomena using the concepts of dynamics and energy 
\item To analyze problems in fluid statics and dynamics
\item To analyze problems in static equilibrium in two- and three-dimensions.
\item To analyze the behavior of materials under tensile and compressive loads.
\item To analyze and solve problems involving beams under a variety of loading conditions
\item To analyze the internal stresses and strains in beams under a variety of loading conditions.
\item To gain enhanced proficiency in the use of computers in a scientific context.
\end{enumerate}
\smallskip
This course also contributes to the partial achievement the competency:
